Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing

Libraries: pandas, numpy for data manipulation; matplotlib, seaborn for visualization.
Steps:
Handled missing values and outliers.
Encoded categorical variables using LabelEncoder.
Standardized numerical features with StandardScaler.
Split data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.



2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions of key financial metrics.
Identified correlations between income, debt, and credit score.
Visualized payment behavior and credit utilization patterns.

3. Machine Learning Models

Credit Score Prediction:
Model: XGBClassifier with SMOTE for class imbalance.
Feature Selection: Optimized using SHAP values.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix.


Customer Segmentation:
Model: KMeans clustering (4 clusters).
Features: Income, EMI, debt, disposable income.
Labels: Premium, Balanced, Emerging, At-Risk.



4. Custom Scoring

Loan Risk Score: Combined payment delays, debt, and credit utilization.
Churn Risk Score: Weighted score based on delay metrics and cash flow.


Results



Task
Key Metrics
Outcome



Credit Score Prediction
~84% accuracy (post-SHAP optimization)
Automated creditworthiness evaluation for faster loan approvals.


Customer Segmentation
4 clusters: Premium, Balanced, Emerging, At-Risk
Tailored marketing strategies for each segment.


Loan Risk Assessment
Flagged high-risk borrowers
Risk-adjusted loan terms to reduce non-performing assets (NPAs).


Churn Risk Prediction
Top 25% flagged as high-risk (Churn_Risk_Flag = 1)
Proactive retention strategies for at-risk customers.


Key Insights

Credit Score Predictors: Total_EMI_per_month, Outstanding_Debt, Monthly_Balance, Delay_from_due_date, Amount_invested_monthly.
Segmentation Profiles:
Premium: High-income, disciplined borrowers.
Balanced: Stable earners with moderate activity.
Emerging: Low-income, consistent customers.
At-Risk: Financially vulnerable with high debt or delays.


Churn Overlap: Strong correlation between At-Risk and low-end Balanced segments.
